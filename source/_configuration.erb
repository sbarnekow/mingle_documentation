## Authentication

### SaaS Customers
For SaaS customers, the Mingle API supports HMAC authentication. 
All API requests to SaaS are made over HTTPS and Mingle On-Site with SSL configured
#### Generating your HMAC key

Unlike basic authentication, HMAC authentication is user specific. Every user can generate one HMAC secret key from the profile page under the HMAC Auth Key tab.

Please note that regenerating your HMAC key will invalidate your existing key.

### On Site Customers 

For On Site customers, the Mingle API supports basic authentication.
#### Configuring basic authentication
To enable basic authentication, set `basic_authentication_enabled: true` in ``<Mingle Data Directory>/config/auth_config.yml``
