The structure of a project resource and its attributes are described below. 

System generated fields such as `created_at` are provided only as information about the project and cannot be updated through the API.

*But can it be deleted?* 

While projects cannot be directly deleted, it can be marked for deletion by setting `marked_for_deletion` to true in an update call. 

Mingle will then take care of deleting the resource.
