The Mingle API is organized around using REST in both XML and JSON data types. Mingle supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests but does put limitations on some of these requests as they apply to Mingle’s logical usage. 

The following documentation will delineate different use cases for Mingle’s API and guide you through ways to use them! On the right side, we offer Ruby, Javascript, and cURL sample code but feel free to submit more use languages, cases, and examples to mingle-api@thoughtworks.com.
