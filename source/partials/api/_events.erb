## Introduction
The event API provides programmatic access to Mingle historical data. This API is readonly.
It has always been possible to subscribe to history in Mingle. However, those subscriptions are oriented toward human readability - generally in a feed reader. In comparison, the event API is oriented toward programmatic access. This programmatic orientation provides many benefits and possibilities for clients to integrate with and consume Mingle data. Potential usages of this API include:
Aggregated feeds between Mingle projects or even other products
Custom filtered Mingle feeds
Activity monitoring
Integrating Mingle with other products
Custom metrics analysis, such as cycle-time analysis and scope change analysis
Structure of the event API
The event API is an atom feed. As an atom feed, the event API is comprised of a feed root element with the feed attributes described below.

## Metadata 
### Feed
The event API is an atom feed. As an atom feed, the event API is comprised of a feed root element with the feed attributes described below.

title: String; The title of this feed.
id: String; The URL for this feed.
link: XML Element; There are several links associated with the feed. These provide information about the feed, in particular it provides information which allows you to navigate through the feed.
updated: Datetime; The time that the last entry on this feed occurred.
entry: Resource; The feed will contain one or more entry elements which describe the Mingle events in the feed. Details can be found in the Entries section on this page.

### Entries
Entries are the core of the the API. Each entry represents one or more Mingle events. Entries are broadly one of the following: card, page, revision, or feed corrections . Although each type of event differ, all events have some common elements.

entry resource xml - attributes
id: String; Identifier of this entry.
title: String; Friendly title for entry.
updated: Datetime; The time that the last entry on this feed occurred.
author: Resource; The user who caused this event. Revision events may only contain a name element, if the person who checked in is not associated with a Mingle user. If a Mingle user is known, the following elements may be present: name, email, uri, and mingle:icon.
link: XML Element; Links associated with the entry. The link contains several attributes about the resource: href (link to resource), rel (definition of the resource), type (type of the resource, e.g., "text/html"), and title.
category: XML Element; Categories associated with the entry. The category contains term and scheme attributes. Term identifies the types of changes that occurred in this entry, e.g., "property-change". There will be one category for each entry with a term of card, page, revision, or feed-correction. This defines the source of the entry.
content: XML Element; Details about the changes that occurred in this entry. E.g., what property changed along with the old and new values. Content will contain a changes XML element which contains individual change elements.
