## Authentication
You can authenticate to the Mingle API using HMAC authencatication.

To get your HMAC key, go to your profile, accessible in the top right corner of your Mingle, and navigate to the tab titled “HMAC Auth Key” where you can use the “Generate” button to generate a new key. This will download a CSV titled “credentials.csv” to your machine which holds your HMAC username and key.  	

<aside class="notice">Please note that regenerating your HMAC key will invalidate your existing key.</aside>

## Making your first request

Each Mingle object comes with standard metadata. 

To illustrate a common use of Mingle’s API, Mingle’s standard card metadata is below : 

### Form Data

card[name] String
    
card[description] Text

card[created_at] DateTime

card[created_by] String

card[type] String

card[number] Integer

card[properties] Array


### XML Data

```xml
<card>
	<name>2</name>
	<description nil="true"></description>
	<card_type>
	<name>Iteration</name>
	</card_type>
	<number type="integer">10</number>
	<properties type="array">
		<property type_description="Automatically generated from the team list" hidden="false">
		<name>Owner</name>
		<value nil="true"></value>
		</property>
	</properties>
	<tags>
	</tags>
</card>
```

### JSON Data

{ :card => { :type => "story", :name => "Test Story" }}


## Ruby

The easiest way to authenticate with Ruby is to use the gem `api-auth`. To install this gem, run `gem install api-auth` and include it in the beginning of your script.

## Javascript

Mingle does not support cross-site scripting.  In order to use Javascript to access the API, you will need to run the code from within Mingle via a our Custom Macro Toolkit, or ported to Mingle. This is only available to On-Site customers.

## cURL

All resources are available via GET request but it is not recommended that users try to submit POST, PUT, or DELETE requests via cURL due to security concerns.
