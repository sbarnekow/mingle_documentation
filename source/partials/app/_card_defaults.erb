Card defaults allow you to add **default content to a card** type so you don't have to repeatedly add standard content. 

For example, you might want to include a story description and an acceptance criteria section to all story cards. 

To add, edit or remove card defaults, go to the **Project admin** type, click **Card types**, and then **Edit defaults** for the desired type.

Then type in your default content with our WYSIWYG editor.

As you can see in the screenshot above, you can also add reports to card defaults, such queries that surface tasks and defaults related to this card, using MQL, Mingle Query Language. [Read more about MQL](#mql).
