After you create your Mingle site (the URL where your Mingle lives), we land you on the card wall of your "Your First Project", which uses our pre-defined Kanban template. You'll see three swimlanes "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" to get you going with the most basic workflow.

You'll also see guiding cards suggesting actions to help you with the onboarding process. Once you've gone through them, feel free to delete them (which you can do individually or with bulk delete on the list view). 

Then start adding your own cards so you can start your work. Just click on the blue + button in the column you want to add work to. You can also drag and drop the "magic card" in the lower left hand corner.

And to invite your team, just click on the pink icon on the bottom tray and enter your teammate's email address.
