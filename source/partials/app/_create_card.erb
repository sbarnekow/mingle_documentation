To create a card, just click on the **blue + button** in the column you want to add work to. When you do this, the newly added card will adopt all of the properties associated with that column.

You can also drag and drop the **"magic card"** in the lower left hand corner. Again, when you do this, the newly added card will adopt all of the properties associated with that column.

N.B. If you just click the "+ Add Card" text and don't use the drag and drop magic card, the newly created card will not adopt the properties of your wall. In such case, it may not appear on your wall since it doesn't match the applied filters. Just a heads up :)
