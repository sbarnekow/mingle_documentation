Mingle is a **project management and collaboration tool** that supports teams across all domains, from agile software development and processes like **Scrum** and **Kanban** to **any process** that has a workflow from start to end. 

The heart and soul of Mingle is **"the card"** and the **"card wall"**. A card can be anything, from a work item to a release. And the card wall, or **board** as it's also often called, is where cards live so you can visualize where they are in your **workflow**.  

Mingle is **completely configurable** so you can imagine practically any workflow and report and Mingle will support it. So, here's to you, your team, and your unique process. Welcome to Mingle.
