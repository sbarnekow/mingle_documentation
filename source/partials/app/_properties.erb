Card properties are custom attributes you can apply to one or many card types. For example, you can add a "priority" property to story, tasks, and defect card types. You can define any property and apply it to any card type. You can use these properties to help **track work**, **create [views](#views)**, and **generate [reports](#reporting)**. 

### Create a Card Property

To create a property, go to the **Project admin** tab and click **Card properties**.

You'll then be prompted to **name your property** (e.g. priority) and, if you'd like, provide description about what this property is meant to track.

Next, choose among the following **property types**:

#### **Managed text**

A managed text property allows you to choose among a list of text values defined by you.

#### **Any text** 

You can also have a property that supports any text value defined by any one on your team.

#### **Managed number**

A managed number property allows you to choose among a list of numerical values defined by you.

#### **Any number**

You can also have a property that supports any numerical value defined by any one on your team.

#### **Team** 

A team property type allows you to choose any team member as the property "value". Team property values are automatically generated to include everyone on your team. 

#### **Date**

Date properties allow you to assign any date as a value.

#### **Formula**

You can create forumla properties using other number or date properties, allowing you to automatically calculate values. **MORE HERE**

#### **Card**

A "card type property" allows you to have any existing card as the value for this property. For example, if I had a "sprint" property, you can choose a specific sprint card as its value.
