Just as you can have **different types of work**, you can have **different types of cards**. For example, you can have a **story** card type, a **task** card type, a **defect** card type, and even a **feature** or **goal** card type. You can also have time-based card types, such as **sprints**, **iterations**, and **releases**. In short, since Mingle is completely configurable, you can have as many card types as you need.

### Create a Card Type

To create a new card type, go to the **Project admin** tab and click **Card types**.

If you have existing card types, you'll see them listed there. **TIP**: If you want to order your card types to determine the order they'll be displayed in drop down menus and lists, you can drag and drop them here.

To create a new card type, click the **Create New Card Type** button and name your new card type.

If you have existing card properties used by other card types, you can **select which properties to apply** to your new card type as well. By default, all properties will be selected, but you can unselect them if you want. And you can also create new properties that can apply to this card type only later on.

### Delete a Card Type

You can only delete a card type if no cards use that type. (The delete button will be disabled if cards use the type and will be enabled if no cards use the type.)

To delete a card type, click the **Delete** link and confirm the deletion. N.B. If any view uses a filter with the card type you're deleting, that view will be deleted.
