**A card can be anything**, from a work item (such as a **story**, **task**, or **defect**) to a **sprint**, **feature**, **goal**, or **release**. You can add **[properties](#properties)** to each card **[type](#types)** so you can track information relavent to specific types of work. For example, a work card could have an "owner" property so you can see who's working on it, and a release card could have a "release date" property so you can see when you're shooting to deliver. You can also **create relationships** between and among cards using **card [trees](#trees)**.
