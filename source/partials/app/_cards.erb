A card can be anything, from a work item (such as a story, task, or defect) to a release (pulling together everything that's going out of that release). You can add what we call "properties" to each card "type" so you can track information relavent to specific types of work. For example, a work card could have an "owner" property so you can see who's working on it, and a release card could have a "release date" property so you can see when you're shooting to deliver. You can also created relationships between and among cards using card "trees".
